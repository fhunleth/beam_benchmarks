%% Each chameneos is its own process.
%% A chameneos sends {self(), Color} to the broker to request a
%% meeting with another chameneos.
%% The broker replies with {Pid, Color} of the partner met or 'stop'
%% whereupon the chameneos prints the Meetings and Selfmeetings it had
%% and replies with the number of Meetings for the broker to sum.
